# ipxer

`ipxer` is a kubernetes based iPXE server.

## TODO

- implement OAPI spec for webhook resolver and transformers.
- generate client & server packages.

## iPXE booting workflow

| Phase             | Action                          | Description                                                                                                                                       |
|-------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `[BOOTSTRAPPING]` | Call `/boot.ipxe`               | Machine starts and DHCP rule 67 specifies your `ipxer` as the next server.                                                                        |
| `[ASSIGNMENT]`    | Chainload `/ipxe?labels=values` | Machine chain load this endpoint specifying labels for scheduling/assignment.                                                                     |
| `[BOOT]`          | Run `#ipxe...`                  | Machine runs the retrieved iPXE manifest, optionally containing uuid references to additional configuration files such as ignition or cloud-init. |
| `[OPTIONAL]`      | Fetch `/config/{uuid}`          | Fetch the optional config identified by a UUID.                                                                                                   |

## Custom Resource Definitions

We designed the Profile and Assignment CRDs in way that let 

### Profile

```yaml
apiVersion: ipxe.cloud.alexandre.mahdhaoui.com/v1alpha1
kind: Profile
metadata:
  name: your-profile
  labels:
    assignment/ipxe-buildarch: aarch64
    assignment/extrinsic-region: us-cal
spec:
  # ipxe string
  ipxe: |
    # ipxe
    command ... --with-config {{ config0 }} --ignition-url {{ ignitionFile }} --or-cloud-init {{ cloudInit }}
  # additionalConfig map[string]string
  additionalConfig:
    config0: |
      YOUR CONFIG HERE
    ignitionFile: |
      YOUR IGNITION CONFIG HERE
    cloudInit: |
      YOUR CLOUD INIT CONFIG HERE
status:
  # UUIDs that are used to fetch
  additionalConfig:
    config0: 89952e35-2a85-4f03-a6b2-7f9526bfafc0
    ignitionFile: 445a4753-3d59-4429-8cea-7db9febdecad
```

### Assignment

Because the `ipxer` should not endorse any `scheduler` or `assigner` role, but serve the purpose of other processes,
assignments should be authored by them.

This purpose is served by the `Assignment` CRD.

TODO: How do we avoid issues w/ conflicting subjectSelectors. Should we rank labels?

```yaml
apiVersion: ipxe.cloud.alexandre.mahdhaoui.com/v1alpha1
kind: Assignment
metadata:
  name: your-assignment
spec:
  # subjectSelector map[string]string
  # the specified labels selects a subject that iPXE boots.
  subjectSelectors:
    serialNumbers: 
      - c4a94672-05a1-4eda-a186-b4aa4544b146
    uuids: 
     - 47c6da67-7477-4970-aa03-84e48ff4f6ad
  # profileSelectors map[string]string
  # the specified labels selects which profile should be used.
  profileSelectors:
    assigment/ipxe/buildarch: aarch64
status:
  conditions: []
```

## Architecture

We have controllers, admission webhooks and a REST API.

The **REST API** is an iPXE server that only serves GET requests. The API endpoints are described below:
- `/boot.ipxe` to chainload into `/ipxe` endpoint.
- `/ipxe?key=value` to load the iPXE manifest assigned to the booting machine.
- `/config/{config-uuid}?key=value` to dynamically load any arbitrary configuration files.

**Admission webhooks** ensures Assignment & Profile custom resources are conform, and optionally enriched them with more
information.

**Controllers** maintain datastructures queried by the REST API.

#### Storage

The storage backend will be done through dedicated CRDs, and or ConfigMaps. There are no reason to use databases.
Even though we need to ensure great performances, we do not need such complex systems. The key-value store from etcd
with the Kubernetes API frontend is more than enough.

In case too many resources are created in the same Kubernetes cluster, we might want to create partition keys for the
kubernetes resources (CRs or CMs) and distribute them into multiple Kubernetes clusters.

## Deployment

Replicas of the REST API queries the datastructures maintained by the controllers. These communications are performed
via mTLS. Hence, cert-manager is required for a production deployment.

## Next features

- MTLS auth (ipxer side): https://ipxe.org/crypto
- Trust (client side): https://ipxe.org/cmd/imgverify
