# This repository is too convoluted.

-> To simplify it: create another repo and start again from scratch.

NOTES:
- Start from the e2e tests, and work backwards.
- Fake adapters to simplify integration/functional/e2e tests.
- Use the http package from the standard library instead of "echo". 
- Do not create unecessary indirections.
